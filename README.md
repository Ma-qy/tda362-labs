# Description
This is the repository for the tutorials of the course TDA362/DIT223 Computer Graphics given at Chalmers University of
Technology. It contains resources and skeleton code which is to be filled in by students in six different lab assignments and one larger project.

# Project in Advanced Computer Graphics Course
I did a solo project in this course which is about fluid simulation and rendering. In this project, I implemented: 
 - Fluid Simulation using WCSPH
     - Neighborhood Searching in CPU
     - Physics Simulation in Compute Shader
     - Kernel Function - Cubic Spline Kernel
 - Water Rendering
    - Depth Texture, Filter, Normal Rebuild
    - Reflection and Refraction of Water
    - Soft Shadow
    - Caustic Effect
- Smoke Simulation and Rendering
    -  Two ways to compute: WCSPH / Buoyancy - Repulsion
    -  Thickness Texture
- Obstacle Handling (Sphere)
    - Fixed-Position Obstacle
    - Floating Obstacle
